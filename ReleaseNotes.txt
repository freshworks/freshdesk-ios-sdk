We’re excited to announce the first public release of our Mobile Chat SDK Version 1.0.0 built to deliver fast, reliable, and intelligent customer support experiences right inside your mobile app.
This launch brings a powerful suite of capabilities spanning real-time conversations, seamless authentication, global readiness, and more.

Key Features
Live Chat with AI & Support Agents
Deliver instant, intelligent, and human-assisted support. Users can engage with AI agents for quick resolutions or connect with support agents in real time.

FAQ Support
Empower customers with self-service. Display FAQs natively within the SDK, helping users find answers instantly without needing to start a chat.

Secure Authentication
Keep user data safe and identify users reliably with robust JWT-based authentication and authorization.

Realtime Push Notifications
Never miss a message. Users receive instant push notifications for new replies, updates, and important communication events.

Localization Support
Reach customers across the globe with fully localized experiences tailored to their preferred language.

Away Experience
Support doesn’t stop when business hours do. Even when your team is offline, customers can still raise chat or email tickets, ensuring their issues are queued and ready for agents to address the moment they’re back online.
